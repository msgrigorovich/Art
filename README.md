    <b>Hi everyone!</b>
</p>

I rarely thought about a professional career in art but I always had a great love for this direction. I have been painting with graphite all my life and focused on portraits but a couple of years ago I became interested in other varieties, such as modeling. I'm not as good at modeling as I am at painting portraits with graphite but I'm happy to develop in this direction! 

This repository contains, perhaps, almost all of my works. You can find them in their respective folders. Each folder contains a `.pdf` consisting of a collection of all the works, so that you do not have to open each one separately (_but, of course, you can do this if you wish_).

## [Graphite portraits](https://github.com/msgrigorovich/Art/tree/main/Graphite%20Portraits)

Of course, first of all I would like to show you some of my favorite graphite works, to which I devoted the vast majority of my life:

In the world of technology it seems like it doesn't matter anymore, but classical art will remain in my heart forever!

>_P.S.: By the way, one of the portraits shows my former Team Lead QA ([Daria Ivanova](https://github.com/Numilou)). Many people don’t even imagine how strange it is to stare at a preson’s photo for about 30 hours in order to draw a portrait._

Unfortunately, a considerable part of my portraits were either lost or given to the appropriate people for the holidays. Therefore, the quality of the photographs leaves much to be desired.

## [3D modelling](https://github.com/msgrigorovich/Art/tree/main/3D%20modeling)

For a while I thought that I would devote my whole life to 3D modeling. If in graphite portraits I came across the idea of capturing a person who inspires me, then in 3D modeling I can do the same, then use an additional dimension for this. This is so impressive!

As a start in 3D modeling, I graduated from [Knover School](https://github.com/msgrigorovich/Art/tree/main/3D%20modeling/Knower%20School). I then used my skills for my own [indie development](https://github.com/msgrigorovich/Art/tree/main/3D%20modeling/basketgolfGame%20project). Several of my works:

If I really dedicated my life to 3D modeling, I would want to model people, the anatomy of their body and face.


## [Game photo mode](https://github.com/msgrigorovich/Art/tree/main/Photo%20mode)

Photo mode in games was a pleasant discovery. I admire games, their open world, detail and atmosphere. Such great achievements require incredible power, and incredible pleasure to capture it. I added only some of my photos to Github, but I’ll pin my favorite ones here:

It may be a little gloomy, but where can you take photos like this, if not in games?
