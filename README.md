My artwork is kept here to demonstrate my sincere affection for creativity and art!

Hi! I'm so glad to see you here!

I rarely thought about a professional career in art but I always had a great love for this direction. I have been painting with graphite all my life and focused on portraits but a couple of years ago I became interested in other varieties, such as modeling. I'm not as good at modeling as I am at painting portraits with graphite but I'm happy to develop in this direction! 

Thank You for watching ;)
